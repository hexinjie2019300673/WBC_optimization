The mobile dual-arm robot considered in this work consists of a wheeled base with three degrees of freedom, a waist with three degrees of freedom, and two manipulator arms with seven degrees of freedom each. The proposed algorithm is designed for real-time joint velocity control, enabling precise trajectory tracking of both end-effectors
